# PACMAN_AI  
These projects were built as a part of AI Coursework at Stony Brook University.  
Naive Bayes: A naive Bayes spam filter which included Laplacian Smoothing to detect emails as spam or ham.  
SCP: Backtracking and Arc-Consistency techniques to detect the markings of a Golomb Ruler.  
Search: Implemented BFS,DFS, A-star search algorithms and heuristics for pacman.  
Tracking: Implemented naive bayes to obtain inference for predicting Ghost position and Pacman's required movements.  
MultiAgent: Implemented Minimax, Expectimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning to help Pacman win over the ghosts.
